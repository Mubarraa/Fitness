We want a fitness app that motivates the user to build their healthy habits, track their fitness progress, and live a consistently healthy lifestyle alongside their Bitmoji. The user's Bitmoji is a representation of their current physical and emotional state which motivates them to make positive changes to their life.  

We have implemented our Hi-Fi Prototype using the collaborative mock-up tool Figma.
